<!-- Dom means  -->

<!-- the all overpage we here right whatever language we use react, angular the dom or the html is making by some objects  -->

<!-- objects are - body/head .....so on -->

<!-- DOM - our document is making by model whats their structure how page looks like if we understand all of this so we easily do manipulation in that/it -->



<!-- like we know about the reduce and so many methods so once we understand this so we easily pick any number from the cards and all creat one more document ans inside that creat one more object and then give it name as a sum and whatever the price calculation of that project we give it sso there are so many things -->

<!-- and then if we understand the event so what happened to press a button and what process happend request goes into web-server or not so if we understand all those events so we know that -->





<!-- console.log(window) --> 
<!-- window is a complex object -->
<!-- so window is a object when we drop it down there are so many thigs it provide -->

<!-- so becouse of window is object -->
<!-- console.log(window.document) -->
<!-- all details about document -->

<!-- so becouse of this is so common so browser also know if we only type (direct acess) -->
<!-- console.log(document) -->

<!-- so we first see if we do this - console.log(window)  so there a lot og things we see their but if we only type this. console.log(document)   so there is only few things show their so for that what we do is    -->


window.dir(document);


<!-- go to figma to see the diagram  -->

<!-- text node is - just simply becouse of dom so all things we call as a node  -->
 <!-- head,body,title,meta they also call as a node (just becouse of fancy words in programming)-->


<!-- this all the things we do  -->
 <!-- console.log(document.location) -->
 <!-- console.log(document.baseURI)  -->


 <!-- all the links we have if we run this command -->
  <!-- but some people think it is a array but it is not it is HTML Collection -->

  <!-- so HTML coll. , Node coll. , and array they all are diff. things. we convert these things into array but it is not an array so becouse of not array so the property like map,foreach it is not available in these -->

 <!-- console.log(document.links) -->

 <!-- but yeah we do and also do these kinda things more-->
 <!-- console.log(document.links[2]) -->


 <!-- if we select anything so it is not that hard using document -->
<!-- we have selection mechanism -->


<!-- document.getElementById('firstHeading') -->
<!-- document.getElementById('firstHeading').innerHTML = '<h1>Negi ji</h1>' -->


<!-- so we do a lot of things using dom manipulation - value change, remove too, new element add, old one remove, filtering all the things we do easily-->
