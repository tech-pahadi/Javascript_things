<!-- the more we learn the dom the more we better in react or crack the interviews   -->

<!-- all the react termonologies and all optimizations things we learn here in this video  -->

<!-- so in this video we learn relations : -->

<!-- parent-child relation -->
<!-- child-child relations  -->
<!-- child-parent relations what all these things -->

<!-- they all help us further then we add our elements into document - creat an element  -->

<!-- we query from the database   - some value comes from there  - then we store that in array - now the next thing we do is to display that in web page
in the form of buttons and cards these is diff. topic it depends - but how to generate new element or remove so all this is a game of dom  -->
